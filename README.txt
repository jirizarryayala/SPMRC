The Sex-Based Precision Medicine Research Core (SPMRC) repository serves as a hub for all of the code generated for projects related to the SPMRC's affiliated research projects. These are divided by: active projects, inactive projects, and general use scripts. 

Active projects: Scripts made specifically for ongoing projects with SPMRC-affiliated researchers. Are actively maintained and are changed with some frequency.
Inactive projects: Scripts made for projects with SPMRC-affiliated researchers which have been concluded. Are not actively maintained, but are preserved in case they become useful at a later point or need to be reference.
General use: Scripts detailing basic procedures. Are to be used as examples or starting points.
